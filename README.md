1. Project Title / Headline
📊 Blinkit Insights: Outlet Sales and Performance Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Blinkit’s sales performance across multiple outlet types, sizes, and item categories—providing clear insights into sales trends, ratings, and product distribution.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The Blinkit Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI report developed to monitor and evaluate business performance across different outlet types and item categories. It enables data-driven decisions by providing visibility into total sales, item distribution, average sales, outlet ratings, and outlet establishment trends.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was developed using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary tool for dashboard design and interactivity.

📂 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and structuring.

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Applied for dynamic calculations such as total sales, average ratings, and conditional measures.

🧩 Data Modeling – Relationships established among outlet, item, and sales tables to enable cross-filtering and aggregate insights.

📁 File Format – .pbix for the dashboard build, .csv as data sources, and .png for preview images.

4. Data Source
Source: Internal Blinkit sales dataset (sample or project-provided dataset).
The data covers various outlets and products, including:

Outlet type, size, and location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)

Item types (Fruits, Snack Foods, Household items, Dairy, Frozen Foods, etc.)

Key performance metrics such as total sales, average sales, number of items, average rating, and visibility scores.

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
Blinkit operates across multiple outlet types and regions, but understanding which outlet type performs best, what product categories drive the most sales, and how sales trends evolve over time was difficult without an integrated analytics tool.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To build a centralized, visually intuitive Power BI dashboard that:
Tracks and compares sales across outlets and item types.
Highlights performance differences by outlet size, location, and fat content.
Supports business decisions in product stocking, outlet expansion, and marketing strategies.
